## Introduction

The *Spotify-Themed Music Player Webpage* is designed to resemble a music player interface inspired by Spotify. Users can browse through a list of songs and control playback using the provided controls. The webpage uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive music player experience.

## Song List

The song list section displays a collection of songs from the "Best of NCS" playlist. Each song entry includes the song title, timestamp, and a play button icon. Users can click on the play button icon to start playback of the corresponding song. The song entries are designed using HTML and styled with CSS.

## Playback Controls

The playback controls section allows users to control the playback of songs. It includes the following controls:

- *Previous*: Clicking this icon skips to the previous song in the playlist.
- *Play/Pause*: Clicking this icon toggles between playing and pausing the currently playing song.
- *Next*: Clicking this icon skips to the next song in the playlist.
- *Progress Bar*: The progress bar indicates the current playback progress of the song. Users can interact with the progress bar to skip to specific positions in the song.

## Song Information

The song information section displays the name of the currently playing song. An animated GIF icon next to the song name adds a dynamic element to the interface. The song information is updated dynamically as users interact with the playback controls.
